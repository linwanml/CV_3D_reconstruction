% function [] = surfaceRender(pointcloud, M, Mean, img)
% project every point on the surface to the main view (camera plane) as reconstructed from sfm,
% and use the projected coordinates to find RGB (texture) colour of the related points.

% Inputs:
% - pointcloud: reconstructed point clould
% - M: transformation matrix of the main view (camera plane) where all
% - points are projected
% - Mean: Mean values of the main view (this will be used during coordinates (de)normalization) 
% - img: corresponding image of main view

% Outputs:
